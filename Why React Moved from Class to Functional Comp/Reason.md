<h1>Why React JS moved from Class Components to Functional Components?</h1>
<p>There are couple of reasons of React JS moving from Class based Components to Functionals Components. Following are some: - </p>
<ul>
<li>
Classes were not as much readable as Functions. Things were getting complicated for simple operations like fetching.
</li>
<li>Class components are difficult/confusing for both humans and Computers to work with.</li>
<li>Many main Class methods are replaced by hooks, So there is no need for using Class Components anymore.</li>
<li>Class Components were hard to test and find bugs.</li>
<li>Code Optimization is also one of the major drawbacks of Class Components</li>
</ul>
